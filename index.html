    <h1> My Cats </h1>
        <p>
          <em> Luna Kamhaji </em>
      </p>
      <p>
         I have two cats at home named Ash and Max. Ash is 6 months old, and Max is 5 years old. <br>
        Until last spring, we had a black cat named Zoro who passed away from lymphoma. <br>
        Due to his death, Max unfortunately fell into a depressive state where he would refuse<br>
        to eat food. Seeing this, we made the difficult descision to adopt a kitten in order for <br>
        Max to have company.
      </p>
      
     <em> <h2> Ash </h2></em>
      <p>
        We adopted my kitten Ash when he was around 1 month old. <br>
        His litter was found abandoned by their feral mother in a construction site <br>
        by a young couple in Brooklyn. </p>

        <p> 
        Although he was a bit timid when he first arrived to our house,<br>
        he has now grown to be a friendly, agile, and playful cat who enjoys <br>
        the presence of people. <br>
      He eats almost everything, to the point where I can't leave food out around him.<br></p>

        <p>
          He loves to sit in very confined spaces, enjoys getting attention, and <br>
          <strong>loves</strong> to eat food. He is more on the extroverted side and will sometimes cuddle <br>
          I believe that he can entertain himself with anything around him and <br>
          is very curious. <br>
          <u>Some of the things I find him playing with are : </u>
          <ul>
            <li> Pieces of string </li>
            <li>Bottlecaps</li>
            <li> Tissue/Toilet paper</li>
            <li> Wires</li>
            <li>My hair</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
        
      <em> <h3> Max </h3></em>
      
     <p> We adopted Max from a cat cafe in Brooklyn sometime in 2019 when he was around <br>
      one year old. He was very playful and curious, but when my other cat Zoro passed away <br>
      Max was very distraught and started to refuse any food and only wanted to sleep. <br>
  After we adopted Ash, he has become a bit more energetic. <br> </p>

   <p>
      Max was very skinny and fragile during his first couple of years with us. <br>
  He used to be a stray and was found with a <mark>spinal injury</mark>, which he got surgery <br>
  for and fortunately recovered, although he has always been a bit clumsy especially <br>
  in his back legs/lower body. For some reason, recently he suddenly gained a lot of weight <br>
  and we were told he is <u>overweight</u> by the vet.  <br>
  He is a very friendly and curious cat, but it is a bit rare for him to cuddle. <br>
